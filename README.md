# Project Abacus

This project features a wide variety of furniture sets, including items that are ready to assemble, kitchen appliances, decor, home accents, and several other goods and services. It displays a straightforward layout that makes it easier for consumers to browse the e-commerce website.

# Design Process

Young adults are generally the target market because they tend to spend more money. To encourage more opulent furniture geared at the customer, we utilize dark color schemes.

# Features

Memory Match: Player turns over two cards as the game begins with all the cards face down. If both cards have the same image, they are kept; otherwise, they are turned back over face down. When every card are faced up, the winner wins.
